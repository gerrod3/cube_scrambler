- The First Release!
- Use Ctrl + Shift + Space bar to launch the pop-up window with a new random scramble. Hit Space to start
the timer and Space again to stop it. Hit 'z' to save the time to your history or 'x' to discard. And 
finally hit 'c' to get a new scramble (this will also reset the timer).
